## Code review

* <del>Could improve your header, it should retract when you scroll down. Or to make it better easier, you could have position: absolute instead of sticky. on your header.</del>

* <del>You could have a random like counter. Instead of having a fixed amount of likes on the page. For example you can use the pre-written function rand in vscode.</del>

* <del>Instead of putting everything in a big div, you could instead use the section tag, it splits up the articles into sections.</del>

* <del>In data.php, you don't need to call the authors by typing in the full array. You could use the id you gave them, which makes the code shorter but also easier to type in.</del>

* <del>You don't need require data in your functions.php, because you're already calling both data and functions in your index.php.</del>
